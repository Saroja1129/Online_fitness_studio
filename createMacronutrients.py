# The script needs to be read from the bottom to the top. The main dietitian home page is initiated after all functions needed are defined.
# 1.) Get single client by pushing button GetClient
# 2.) Create Diet Plan Option and/or Create Supplement Option are implemented as buttons
# 3.) Create Diet Plan calls showDietPlan, which shows the current diet plan: 
    # it pulls the data from an existing dietary plan from the database and if not existent it fills the output with 0's
# 4.) showDietPlan calls inputDietPlan that saves input data from the white entry options into the database by pushing the button OK
# 5.) The button ok calls insert_or_update function
# 6.) insert_or_update: checks if current plan values are available, if not creates a new dietary plan by inserting values in diatray_plan and plan_macronutrients
#      values rae provided as input by the advisor user. If a plan exists, the an update query performs the database updates
